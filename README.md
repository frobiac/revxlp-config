# Setup and Build

Setup `west`, zmk-firmware, zephyr (minimal) according to docs.

    cd zmk-firmware/app
    west build -b seeeduino_xiao_ble -- -DSHIELD=revxlp -DZMK_CONFIG=/<FULL_PATH_TO>/revxlp-config/config

Copy `build/zephyr/zmk.uf2` to controller

Also needs MouseKeys-support, currently from branch `mouse-3.2` of [urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk) ZMK repo:
To configure, run `west build -t menuconfig` and select mouse option there,  or `echo 'CONFIG_ZMK_MOUSE=y' >> app/prj.conf`.
Should be default with latest change to 'revxlp.conf'.
